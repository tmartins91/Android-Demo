# Android-Demo
My Android demo project

This is a small project that shows a simple list of countries and some details about them. The propose is show how it can be build using depency injection with dagger2. I would like to continue the demo adding Android fragments and UI interactions.

To get the countries list, I used a free API from Fabian7593.
